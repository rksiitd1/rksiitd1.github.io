</p><p id="c0776935-24f8-48d2-be7d-3f932a0c298a" class="">Let me assess your knowledge.</p><p id="df6d8f07-ef28-4156-8984-56bd5ee28703" class="">[1] How many of you know what CRISPR-Cas9 is? Ah, I see your eyes glowing! Your inner demon is smiling. But well, how many of you can give an hour-long lecture on it? How many of you know the actual mechanism through which it works—not the cartoon diagram method, yes, the method usually found in textbooks and online blogs isn’t the exact mechanism through which CRISPR works. The mechanism of CRISPR is rather complex and not as simplistic as it is described in scissor and paper cartoon diagrams. How many of you knew that? Of course, many of you? But to tell you the truth, I have seen professors of DBEB who do not read the exact mechanism and come to class with flashy PowerPoints where they have nothing but a screenshot from some textbook or an image they found somewhere on Google Images. With that, they try to explain how exactly it works. Well, anyone who bases their theory on pictures and not on actual protocols, like the professors of DBEB, ends up speaking nonsense, complete rubbish in the class because they didn’t study the text written in the book. They just look at the pictures and try to explain the pictorial diagrams they didn’t create but copied from somewhere else. </p><p id="c7faa6dc-fae6-47b4-af27-81fa112fa9b7" class="">&quot;A knowledge that is not grown within you is a borrowed knowledge and gives you a false sense of knowing, and you still remain ignorant.&quot; — Osho Rajneesh. </p><p id="cec892fb-bc5c-443f-b53b-67a6e566a99e" class="">In an era when the nanoscopic genetic machine, which is not even considered alive in real terms, a virus, tried to wipe out humanity and render four billion years of evolution useless and laughable for the most intelligent species on this planet, Professor Shilpi of DBEB, IITD, came to the class and spoke rubbish in the name of explaining the rolling circle mechanism. All was recorded on Microsoft Teams, and I have kept a clip. Why did such an incident happen? Why was it that a professor who considers herself so great didn’t even know the simple rolling circle mechanism of viral replication?</p><p id="19400f87-e38e-4e23-804b-7201a222b320" class="">She didn’t learn that during her UG because no one taught her in the colleges of the famous Banaras Hindu University. Oh yeah, I have seen her college, in the exact same college, I had my exam for the NDA in 2019. No one taught her that during her Masters, and she topped the university. Actually, as she writes on her CV, she topped in both UG and PG. Anyone can understand, simple, it’s a scam. Well, you don’t possess that great knowledge, and most people top in such situations in any university on the basis of random probabilistic outcomes. Thus, it cannot happen twice. You cannot become the topper two times. If that happens, it implies two things — one possibility is that you are a super genius, and if that’s not true, then it&#x27;s a scam. There is nothing else to think here. These two outcomes make an exhaustive set of outcomes for the purpose of calculating probability. Since anyone can see that Shilpi does not possess some scholarly great wealth of knowledge, it is clear that it was a scam, just the way things usually happen, like it popularly happens in state boards like Bihar Board or even NEET or let’s say UGC-NET, or if you are a cricket fanatic, you can think of it as a match-fixing phenomenon. Well, I don’t need to dig deep into all that. All I want to talk about here is the rolling circle mechanism. What a pathetic university, whose top biology graduate doesn’t even know what the rolling circle mechanism is. Anyway, who cares! Everyone knows the purpose of such a university. </p><p id="b844e313-775a-416a-b33c-03b5167276b5" class="">When I am ridiculing Shilpi’s alma mater, I see the smile on her face. I even know what exactly she is thinking. She knows how exactly the same crony bribery mechanism works in DBEB, IIT-D because she is at the center of it. Yes, she is there. She knows how to increase the grades of the prince of Delhi and his beloved. She knows how and whom to appoint CR even without an election or against it. Dev was selected convenor of the class by Shilpi without any formal or informal election. She knows how to spy on the class, who would be the best one for the position of a spy. Dev continued to spy on the class even after he lost the real election for CR to Paras in a very pathetic way. In fact, Paras got nothing but ridicule from professors. This is a good analogy to understand how exactly the deep state continues to rule the world regardless of who wins, Joe or Trump, in the American election. She knows how to indirectly bully people who oppose her tyranny. There are several incidents, she threatened boys in my hostel by mail just because they had written a bad review about her and her course on the eacad course feedback. After that incident, no one dared to write anything against professors ever on the so-called anonymous feedback. Yes, eacad feedbacks are supposed to be anonymous, but they are barely anonymous. Everyone knows who has written what. Yes, she is like the monster Margaret Thatcher of DBEB, but in the clothes of Dimple Yadav. London inside, Lucknow outside. Just look at her smile, I love her smile, she is very beautiful. Dear Shilpi, I really, really love you. In fact, everyone loves you. We like such people who are like the pillars of DBEB on which it sustains itself, except that tyranny is never good. </p><p id="3b895ba3-dc1b-4c3b-b7b3-116f1f8df0e5" class="">Did you focus on the sentences that you just read? Exactly, this is all flattery, and I am not writing all that. Go to her lab, and you will find on the big green notice board, written with seven-color pens, “Dear Ma’am, we all love you.” I mean, what’s that? Is that some quote from Isaac Newton or J. C. Bose? Maybe it was written by a great spiritual leader like Aurobindo Ghosh, I don’t know. Its great mechanism of controlling people thought and opinions regarding you, if you don’t understand the mechanism, read the book titled “The Secret Codes.” Well, everyone knows how tyrants try to portray themselves as all-loving and as if they themselves are the all-pervading God. Mr. Modi is trying to make a point that he is very much a God. Well, great people never liked that. It is only the tyrants like Stalin or the current NK leader who try to promote such images. </p><p id="9dad488c-b7f2-44fa-ba2c-c12f88ed62e9" class="">Words are lifeless, nothing but psychological constructs. There is no meaning to any words. In fact, if you deeply seek meaning, finding meaning itself is a useless activity/pursuit. Meaning is an illusion. An illusion exists only because your mind is lying to you, and instead of providing you the truth, the reality, it is providing a mesmerizing perceptual virtual satiation to you. Not too far in the future, we will see several of Mr. Modi’s gang members becoming lifeless and returning to the ground. It doesn’t matter whether you are a PM from Varanasi, an MP from there, or a P.A., peon, cleaner, slave; the Ghats of Banaras have seen all kinds of people, not in thousands, but in millions, from day-to-day tyrants to the most vicious criminals. When the infamous Bhasmasur himself couldn’t sustain and eventually turned into Alankara of lord Vishwanath, who do you think you are? One day you too will find the same fate, no matter how much research you do to stop telomere shortening. Your friend Bryan Johnson too will die one day, no matter how much he preaches to others, “Don’t die,” “Don’t die.” Memes won’t save him. </p><p id="62c94b6f-a326-4e2f-b07a-ba41a75d87df" class="">Anyway, since you were smiling, I was just thinking about maybe we can collaborate on exposing how exactly the deep bribery-based crony mechanism works inside DBEB and IITD in general. I am very soon going to expose that as well on short notice. Maybe you can secretly guide me without your name coming to the forefront. Think about that. </p><p id="1a8a032d-e066-403a-b0d2-928c58276d1a" class="">After BHU, she was admitted to some random, stupid, pathetic, third-rate German university which no one values, for her Ph.D. There, she learned nothing because her PI kept her on dishwashing work for four years, and she had only one year to jot down her thesis by any means and get rid of that rubbish lab which treated her like a slave and not like a researcher. They asked for obedience more than they ever promoted free thinking or helped her to inculcate critical thinking skills. After all, why should they give access to great resources and let someone from India know the secrets of how great things are invented? </p><p id="5b39e0cd-f2ce-4b26-a010-165535d76c21" class="">There was no ChatGPT available to her. In fact, ChatGPT writes much better than anything she can ever come up with. Well, it is not her, it’s every single one of DBEB. Ah, she didn’t even have <a href="http://quillbot.com/">Quillbot.com</a> for paraphrasing. Did she use <a href="http://grammarly.com/">Grammarly.com</a>? I don’t think she had such help with grammar for what she wrote. Ah, she didn’t have her favorite software “Turnitin.” Turn-it-in. She used to write copy-paste from journal articles, and the journal used to send it back, stating that she had copied 43% of the text. No, no, Shilpi, I am not talking about Pulkit Agarwal’s term paper with a 44% plagiarism result. Well, don not worry, Kejriwal is just another mutated variant of Agarwal, belonging to the great clan of Agrasen mentioned in Mahabharata and related texts like Prem Sagar etc., and we can comfortably exchange them, but can we talk about such things, is that allowed, how dare I? I can feel free to condemn you even more than reality, maybe, but how dare I condemn the prince of Delhi? Prince Saleem and Anarkali’s love stories are so charming, who dared to even talk about it in the entire Delhi Sultanate. </p><p id="7811c232-a62c-4cb5-9636-663d28aab52b" class="">Forget the use of complex bioinformatics tools, does she even know how to use trivial tools like <a href="http://biorender.com/">BioRender.com</a>, MATLAB Simulink, R, or Excel properly, which biologists with no mathematical or computing skills use? Nowadays, she is using ChatGPT and feeling like wow, where was it when I had to write that paper, for which I got slapped several times just because I didn’t paraphrase it well. She imagines if she had ChatGPT at that time, she could have completed her whole thesis within a month. Why would she need a month? She could have done it in one week, or even three days. Well, I can produce a better thesis than hers of 102 pages pdf, within 6 hours, if all had to do is to produce a document having jargon written on it. Since her IQ is not even 70% of mine, I cannot expect this from her in 6 hours, but I think a time frame of 72 hours would be enough for even the low brainer people like hers. Not just that, if ChatGPT would have existed, she would never feel ashamed of her thesis, which she feels when she looks at it now. She tries hard to not put it on the internet, fearing that kids nowadays are very advanced and they may run it on Turnitin, or look at the sentence structure and laugh. She again thinks, anyway, there is no radically great thinking she contributed through her thesis. All she did was produce jargon in the name of science, copy from here, copy from there, paraphrase this, paraphrase that. No one was there to help if she had a doubt, nowadays even kids from remote villages of India can sit in front of ChatGPT and keep nudging it will endless questions as if GPT is their very girlfriend, Reliance Jio 4G/5G has made everything highly democratic, even though Sam and Mukesh are making tons of money, this was never possible ever in the history. </p><p id="99aecc44-b066-4ea3-8d75-17a8edf1d0b6" class="">The guide only condemned her writings and enjoyed doing that; that was pretty much part of the German attitude. She reaffirms in her mind, long ago, it was a very bad situation. Very poor condition. A naturally smaller brain of a woman and a lot of work. So much tension, so much compression, so much heat generation, and no one cares. Do you know she didn’t even had a laptop? Ahhhhh, very, very poor condition. How do you write a paper without having the knowledge of even the word file, I wonder. Do not worry, later on, she bought a laptop, but since she didn’t have the money, she used an old outdated version of pirated Windows 8 or even older versions of that, yeah haha. Many times I do think about how exactly she could enter into IIT. So crap. It is a good question to ponder about how do such craps from Banaras, Allahabad, and Kanpur, who are totally no-brainers, get into IIT Delhi-like ultra-great institutions? Even when they have entered somehow by some mechanisms, we must try out procedures to expel them out and show them the path back to the place from wherever they have come. They are total idiots. </p><p id="f4db42b7-f40b-41e0-9ec0-d0efda5f7d37" class="">Of course, learning how to clean pipettes and how to wash the beaker will by no means help you win the Nobel Prize. You will become a good laborer but not a great thinker if you just keep doing Petri plates and agarose. There is nothing great there; everything has already been known. What great things do you expect a bicycle repairer and cleaner to invent really? Nothing, and everyone knows that, still you had to work like that because they thought it was easier, cheaper, and more convenient to hire you compared to anyone else on this planet earth. Exactly, a Ph.D. doesn’t increase your knowledge; if you are stupid, you will remain so. And thus, Shilpi didn’t learn what the rolling circle mechanism is even after completing her Ph.D. </p><p id="58ea26d1-586a-470f-bd0b-a3a9cabbec36" class="">She lived at her ancestral house in Benares for one year because she didn’t get any job immediately after the Ph.D., where her toxic uncles and aunties kept scoffing about her in the background. Ah, we thought that you were studying at a great university in Germany, what happened, you couldn’t even get a job? That <em>Sharmaji ka ladka</em> cleared the UPSC civil services exam and became an IPS officer at the age of just 22, currently appointed in Sandeshkhali district of WB, he is very, very intelligent, really, really. You know what, she never bowed down, but she used to rail them back instantly with 300x more intensity of the coming waves. Why do I have to mention this? It’s because even in that one year, when she was at home doing nothing of much importance, she didn’t focus on studying; instead, she focused on fighting with others. </p><p id="34ea6550-9945-46f9-b623-2ad1b4fa7296" class="">Look at her arguments. She brought a six-month-old “The Hindu” newspaper front page, which was about the interview of a UPSC topper of the same batch named “Sukriyo Chakravorty (21),” a Bengali Brahmin, an IISc UG Biology graduate, who even after not just clearing the exam but getting AIR-1, went to the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, an institute created/reserved for advanced biotech research without any typical hurdles usually faced at typical university administrations, for pursuing a Ph.D. in chemical biology. He condemned such superficial pursuits of the country’s youth who are wasting their youth just for the sake of becoming a bureaucrat, where they end up doing corruption, etc., not because they were inherently genetically dishonest from the day they were born, but because the system enforces them to participate in such vicious activities. He bet that in the not-too-distant future, an AI would be able to do the job of an IAS officer in a much better way than a human. Automated robotic systems would be able to catch the evils at a much faster and safer way than any cabal of human police systems. The job of an IAS/IPS would become obsolete with no meaning attached to it, no intellectual labor needed at the workstation. They would simply be watchers and invigilators, exactly the way in the Middle Ages in Europe there used to be chaperones for guiding newly married couples. He emphasized the fact that in the future, only hardcore thinkers and disruptive innovators would find that there is some meaning in life; for others, life would completely seem useless. </p><p id="0033f6c1-78d2-47e1-9c84-ceca85c2555d" class="">Now, look at Shilpi, does she understand all these facts? Can she even define what AI is? Yet she won the arguments in front of others. She knows how to show herself greater in front of others; that much she has learned anyway. If I had asked her to let us see her rank in the UPSC and not show other’s achievements, how could she do that? She does not study at all and keeps fighting with others. Why am I describing it all here? Because of her fighting nature, she didn’t learn the rolling circle mechanism even in that one year of the golden gap. </p><p id="55cd89e4-98db-4ea4-b88a-99600de1d82f" class="">Whenever I see someone titled “Sharma,” you know what, the immediate response in my brain is that these people are all frauds, low-level juggadu thinkers, superficial people having no depth in their lives. All they have learned is how to brag in front of others, and they invent newer and newer methods of abusing others. No one can compete with them when it comes to the synthesis of swear words. For example, is there anyone in the world who can think of converting the term “Muslim” to “Chuslim?” This is not good for diversity and inclusion in this country. I would like to spit on someone who does such conversions. That’s the fundamental reason I joined the RSS. At RSS, we believe in creating a very good atmosphere in this country. We don’t just believe that everyone in the country is equal, but we are working on a scientific project to prove that every single Muslim that exists in this country is genetically the same as the Hindus of this country. Thus, there is no reason to do any kind of discrimination. Everyone who exists in this subcontinent is genetically the same. This is the basis of scientific brotherhood, and whoever refuses to accept, we do not beat them the way they do in Afghanistan or Iran or Syria probably. We send them to good universities like AMU and Jamia on full funding from the government and intensely teach them the core of the theory of evolution, genetics, anthropology, and molecular biology. We don’t believe that a person is inherently born an idiot; we believe in gradual improvement by means of uplifting the soul of the country through banning negative news from every single news channel and showing only Akhand Bharat, total union, one world super brotherhood theories. Thus, I condemn anyone and everyone who invents terms like “Chuslim.” There is no such thing in the entire Bharatiya subcontinent and “All animals are equal.” That’s the theory of “Animalism” George Orwell, the world-known Bihari proposed. </p><p id="9843c0a9-5cb5-42b2-a8c6-9b17021ba629" class="">Do you understand now why “Shilpi” has not studied the “rolling circle mechanism?” If you study under Shilpi, you would start believing in the “flat earth theory,” just like typical low IQ people. In advanced spiritual books, it is advised not to be with low IQ people because if you live with them, your IQ will decrease. When you prioritize fighting more than studying, exactly this is what happens: your attitude gets sky-high, and your brain reduces to pea size. Exactly the same way a dinosaur has a very huge body, while the brain is not more than the size of a pea. Crying like cats in class and spewing venom everywhere doesn’t show any kind of intelligence or foster it. </p><p id="f9161cc6-c41c-4913-b3af-7e5cf0ba2612" class="">Intelligence is endowed to only those who are humble enough to accept the truth and intensely devote their entire life to learning something new every single day with an exponentially increasing level of curiosity and do not let their enthusiasm ever go bankrupt. Bankruptcy of enthusiasm leads to hell. Not everyone becomes Vivekananda. There are very few who get even close to Ramanujan, let alone cross him. </p><p id="27493dc8-eaaa-4295-80b8-ac2ec4de0b96" class="">She was a professor at NIT Allahabad. Yes, she went from Kashi to Prayagraj, and she is very, very proud of that internally, but you know if you have been there, it is truly a society based on “bakaiti,” useless ego-enhancing talks everywhere, a failed society, superstitious beliefs, where she learned nothing. There was no one to point out her mistakes during the lectures. Whatever she spoke, everyone accepted as if Allah himself was saying it, and if anyone dared to speak against it, two things were bound to happen: one, you are bound to go to hell and get beaten there for infinite time with a hot iron-barbed wire rod; secondly, you will miss the 72 hoors which you would have gotten otherwise. One can never even imagine missing the latter one. Well, after NIT-A, she made her way to the grand IIT-D through various means of dark methods which can’t be described here in the interest of not destroying her privacy. </p><p id="112282b7-636c-423a-bb01-bc858cedfe4d" class="">There she taught only one course, i.e., microbiology, for 1.1 decades, yet she never read about the rolling circle mechanism, which is something there on her slides she made in early 2010. Yes, she has not even changed a single letter from that slide in the last 10 years; it is as it was. She wakes up early every single odd semester, brings out the slides from the cold store—yes, the exact same cold store where the farmers of Gorakhpur keep their potato packets to preserve them from the heat at home. After the slides come out, she does not even look at them. Again, this is not her confidence; it is her ego, and she takes those slides directly to class. The PowerPoint is aired, and she starts screaming. I cannot use the verb “lecturing”; I don’t think these people have any idea about what the word “lecture” means. </p><p id="bb11f8d9-f1d1-4fdf-83b9-13aa36581fd0" class="">By the way, the idiots who sit on the benches of LHC of IITD are not different. They too chase the hoors, but they do not look at the seventh sky for the hoors, they imagine hoors of BCG, McKinsey, Bain, and Goldman Sachs. If some hoor didn’t allow them to hold her hand in Bangalore’s 9-7 and Idli Dosa busy life, of course, Bangalore is not as advanced as it is wowed in Delhi, they do so since they are bored there. If you belong to the top 10 percent of the Machiavellian hierarchy of greater man, you will get everything, but by any means, if you fall short on any of those characteristics, you will just dream about breaking pizza one day. You will have to control yourself by simply ordering pizza from Zomato or Dominos at 12:11 AM night while watching Netflix, keeping the laptop above your belly, lying on bed. Baby sleep, it is not lectures of IITD where you could keep proxying since you went to sleep at 4 in the morning.</p><p id="122e610f-ee87-4b15-a0d9-91cf5f7383d3" class="">Exactly, that’s the same reason, the dream of hoors which castrates most of those who attend Shilpi’s classes at 11 AM thrice a week for three credits. If they speak against her, they would be degraded, thus missing the mark for getting the hoors. I request and suggest all of them to criticize her to the bones because if you don’t do so and internally castrate yourself, your inner will, your spirit, anyway, hoors would be meaningless, and you would barely be able to do something even if got one. </p><p id="7de19d05-e1d9-4ece-b2dd-399d2fc08431" class=""><strong>Veerah Bhogya Vasundhara</strong> (the earth is enjoyed by the brave) <div class="indented"><p id="550154f4-a58d-4d00-bab5-9c50a3268411" class="">— Shiva Purana, Rudra Samhita, Yudh Khanda, Chapter 32, Verse 18</p></div></p><p id="c70a0acd-a435-4113-abf1-8a99628c3e49" class="">You get my point, why exactly no one told Shilpi that she is preaching it all wrong?

But, I must ask you all, how many of you internally feel that without looking at the notes and cheat sheets, you are good to go for delivering a lecture on CRISPR-Cas9? Simple, very few of you, even though you all are professors of biotechnology. Exactly, I know how much you know. There is nothing hidden from me. I surely know how much you know and what exactly, where you would like to pretend that you know, but all you know is just bluff; nothing on a real scale. Shilpi, I still challenge you if you can without looking at the internet or here and there be able to tell me the exact mechanism of rolling circle viral replication, I would give you $1000 instantly, and I would never make that clip public, I promise you. But sigh, she still do not know what is rolling circle mechanism exactly, after mine class, she may have taught three more years with the same rubbish theory, in fact I have mailed her regarding that in the past, but she cannot change, how can she?

Should I check your Google Scholar profiles? Should I assess them? Do you dare? I have seen that most DBEB professors are so cowardice that they do not keep their theses online. If you look at most great researchers, you can find the link to their PhD thesis on their Google Scholar page. Shilpi, have you put yours there? Do you dare? I don’t think you can do so. Ah, I just found her thesis. I am amazed. Let me download it before she removes it from there, just like Prof. Ishaan deleted his Facebook page, haha. Don’t do that, don’t delete it, please.

Oh, that’s not something to laugh at. Even if you think about the famous early physicists like Erwin Schrödinger or Heisenberg, their theses were probably around 79 pages or so. Thus, we cannot laugh just by looking at the number of pages in her thesis. It is another matter that now people write some 200 pages or so. Still, the number of pages does not matter at all. You may write five people&#x27;s theses, and you may still remain an idiot. Exactly, look at the content. Here is her CV:</p><p id="1ef8aacd-010c-4bd4-b4ac-7c685110e985" class="">

Tables are very trivial. Now let’s see all the picture, I mean how do feel, I think I did produce more such picture when I was there in professor KJMs lab for just 2 months than what she have done in the entire thesis of hers. What kind of thesis you have written dear? I would not like to break down every single part, may god give you power to brag a bit. Anyway, when you fight someone, wise people have said, leave a pathway for the other would to run away, thus I must follow that rule, since if you restrict all the pathways, believe it or not, you are inviting a enemy with three time more power. My dear I do not want to roast you that much, your thesis is awesome. Its lovely. Ah, look at this flow chart, I love this flow chart, do you know why, because Professor Preeti asked me make such flow charts in the lab report and I had made it for every single experiment myself, but then the way you checked my Lab notebook, only I know, you know or Professor Sunder knows, yes he too knows about how exactly you checked my lab report, that’s a deep matter, but I here I present your flowchart:</p><p id="dcafdeef-2740-41fd-b097-587eadfdd452" class="">

Now let’s move on, I am getting interested in running her thesis on Turnitin, should I do that, well, I just run it on Grammarly. The Grammarly is pointing out some 300 of grammatical mistakes in the entire thesis of hers. But that’s not something to bother actually, it is fair enough. Here is technical report about the number of words in her thesis:</p><p id="14b370a5-9279-4614-afc5-7f83bcb665d1" class="">

</p><p id="fdbe7583-af1e-4167-a0e7-561bf3ba9618" class="">The total number of words in her thesis is 28,827, and the number of sentences is 3,046. That’s it. Ah, I see something very interesting—her brother-in-law has the same name as mine. Oops! I have rarely found a person with exactly my name. I mean, I haven’t encountered anyone anywhere. It looks really awesome; I don’t know what she must be feeling about my name. But for sure, whenever I send an email, the name she reads and the feeling she gets would be very, very familiar. In truth, now she must be finding more equations. The three-word name, with “Kumar” in the middle, is also a magical name for her. Rarely do people keep “Kumar” in between. In fact, it is only those whose parents weren’t very smart and were experimenting with how the name should be written, secondly, the teachers of primary school may have been idiots as well, who made the name that way. Either keep the “Kumar” or the surname; don’t keep both. By the way, it’s okay. Bihar or UP was very different in 1999 or even 1996, but most people forget it. I just wanted to remind them. People face hardships and then forget them when they start getting a little richer. But she must have understood the meaning. Now, the magical number is making things more and more interesting to me.</p><p id="083eb94e-7527-49dd-9ede-018c49433bcb" class="">Now I think I should move towards your Google Scholar pages. Well, I can see some 131 papers here, but your h-index is very flat; people don’t cite your papers much. Do you really know how the h-index is calculated? Yes, a researcher’s popularity is not checked by the number of papers; instead, you look at the h-index. An h-index of 155 is considered indicative of a world-famous scientist. We can consider that you are famous enough in India even if you have 55, but well, it is very, very flat. I have this feeling that you don’t properly understand how exactly the h-index is calculated. Well, I should not nudge you that much. You are very nice, nicer. By the way, did you know that “NICER” is also a genome engineering technology? Ah, yes, it came out just a year ago, if I remember it correctly. Read about that; you would love it. Really, really nice. Ah, I see, who are these two US UG kiddos for whom you have published the papers, one paper? Two paper? Who are they, ma’am? I am getting very, very interested in them. Did they pay you some? Well, I must not ask such things. I do know how hard it is for professors to get a single paper published. Many professors yearn for some UG kid’s father paying the price of the publication. PhDs are anyway employed on low salaries. It is UG ones who dream of getting into a good university for grad school who pay professors for getting a paper published. Don’t worry, I am not going to condemn you for that; you are very nice, ma’am.</p><p id="a6b72efc-6fea-4a38-a400-3ba92d6c34f1" class="">Next time when you get the research grant, buy that “red tempo” that you have always dreamt of. Don’t stifle yourself. Life is for enjoying and not getting messed up in the endless caricature of ethics and morality, which is not some fundamental law of physics but simply has been created by state-sponsored brainwashers of the past, typically termed as pope, prophet, pundit, professor, printing press, etc. Even when Mr. Gandhi did his work in India, he was not that stupid to work without any financial support. He used all his power, in truth it was not power, but popularity in order to serve Birla’s great empire fight with the British empire and acquire more businesses in India. He enjoyed everything, and Sarojini has written it correctly, in order to show MKG poor, it takes a lot of money. He slept with multiple women just for the sake of testing his Brahmacharya. Basically, he truly did know how to enjoy. </p><p id="17e93b7f-e2d3-4572-8181-321df80831c9" class="">We are seeing another kind of Gandhi in Delhi, who tries to portray himself as a person who uses “Reynolds 045” in his pocket, very poor dress, but wait, he is not lesser than Gandhi, he has constructed his Sheesh Mahal. What a revolutionary! Don’t worry, I am not trying to hurt your favorite student’s father, he is my uncle too, and we are friends after all. In fact, I have given him the idea of how Bhagat Singh played five-dimensional chess in front of Gandhi to instill people’s attention from Gandhi towards him, but some people miss my gist. What can I do? Politics is not for the low-IQ people working against the master. The first law itself is to “never outshine the master.” Those who condemn Nitish, saying he bowed down in front of Modi during the meeting, diminishing the entire state’s glory, it is their ego because of which they can’t understand the fine arts of ruling the world peacefully, the way that British princess did, flattering the entire internal and external aristocrats.</p><p id="1363f374-da69-4d11-8d93-59c653e5f434" class="">All the best Shilpi for your life and your work, we should agree to disagree a few times.

Of course, I know that very few of you have any interest in such things. Most of you are simply doing a “Sarkari Naukri,” which you got for various unspeakable reasons like favoritism, nepotism, cronyism, bribery, and so on. Many of you have this attitude that it’s a “Sarkari Naukri”—no one can remove you, no one can fire you from here, so you will do what you want and just chill. &quot;Ab kya, ab kaun hata sakta hai 60 saal ke niche.&quot; Of course, that’s the typical mindset of every “Sarkari Naukar.” Apparently, you are right; but it is disgraceful to see this kind of mindset in IIT Delhi, the nation&#x27;s most prominent institute’s professors having such a mentality. Super pathetic. Ultra super pathetic pro max. You’re a shame in the name of a professor or researcher. Now, people ask me on Twitter why exactly IITs have such low research output. Exactly, they can’t smell these things; that’s why they ask such questions. </p><p id="8731b6ed-4bab-4d49-b557-000193efa161" class="">But, do not worry, whatever happened to Vishal Vaibhav, tomorrow evening can happen to you too, don’t chill so much, abusing people won’t help you, anyway I talked to Vishal, he was a cute kid during his time at IIT Delhi, he learned how to abuse people in the Jwalamukhi hostel itself, prior to that he had no exposure of using swear words. A year ago, I met this guy, and he disrespected the whole department by misnaming it as “Department of Backchodi.” I was surprised to hear how exactly other department people see my department, it is bad, but that doesn’t imply anyone on the internet can say anything, I couldn’t say anything at that time, but time knows everything, it teaches the lessons to everyone, no one would be exempted from getting the fruits of their Karma.</p><p id="9c211efe-0855-4e8f-9046-c5d3382edace" class="">[7] Okay, enough of shaming you guys. Let’s do some exercise that can enhance and boost your energy. How many of you can tell me the difference between prime editing and bridge editing? Run and find out, run, run, run… I am giving you a hint: ask ChatGPT or Claude. Yes, if you don’t know, Claude’s new model “Sonnet 3.5” is outperforming ChatGPT-4o, which is/was the state-of-the-art from OpenAI. Of course, I know that none of you are going to read any research paper related to these. I mean, of course, I don’t expect you to read research papers regarding how LLMs work, but I was saying, you guys would not be able to read about even the “prime editing” and “bridge editing.”</p><p id="f739de14-8762-4f1b-8497-19f503d6aec6" class="">[8] Exactly, that’s correct! None of you read research papers regularly, that’s the truth! Many would raise their eyebrows about how that can happen since doing a PhD requires a huge amount of reading and a huge, huge, huge literature review. But that’s a myth. It is true that it requires a huge amount of literature review to get a PhD, but that doesn’t imply that many of you have really gone through that process. How do I know? From the way you teach. Some great person has said, “When you open your mouth to speak, you reveal everything about yourself. You can rarely hide many things about yourself; a wise person can easily see all that you are.” Most of you show your weaknesses when you come to lecture in the class. The way you teach speaks a lot about you. How can you hide that? There is no way. I have heard from top researchers, who are working on state-of-the-art technologies, that it requires internalizing only 40 papers by heart in a field to master 90% of the field. Of course, those 40 papers must be masterpieces, but how many of you have done that? Let me not go deeper; I can even name people, but that would open another Pandora&#x27;s box.</p><p id="e104de2a-4364-4aea-9375-6b0390581d2c" class="">[9] Again, since I have started talking about research papers, let me tell you something. I did a course on brain-machine interfaces from Prof. Saurabh Gandhi of the EE department. It was a completely awesome course. To tell you the truth, he didn’t recommend a single book or come up with nice-looking slides to flash in front of our eyes and mesmerize us with the design and art of the slides. All that was done in the class was discussing a different state-of-the-art research paper published within the last 5 years every single day. That’s how classes should be. It shouldn’t be that idiots come to class with some 1970 author’s outdated reference book and start speaking all that they remember. That’s completely rubbish, especially when it is an elective course. Completely boring lecture which no one wants to listen to. </p><p id="afab91ce-71b6-44c7-bca9-42c6d7a2a82d" class="">Again, let me tell you, Prof. Saurabh awarded 40% of the marks for asking questions. Yes, if you ask more questions, you will get more marks. The quality of your questions is important, and it is only possible if you understand the subject deeply. You cannot ask a question if you don’t understand what is being discussed. The more you engage in the discussion, the more marks you will get. Exactly, that’s how grading should be, and not the typical classes where if you ask a question, the professor gets angry, throws you out of the class, or degrades your grade internally so that you never ask a question again. But what can a guy do whose own knowledge is laughable, penniless?</p><p id="0f752d16-350a-4767-9198-c39b4f77c029" class="">[10] Exactly, when I asked Professor K. J. Mukherjee to provide some research papers regarding enzyme science, he was like, “It would become hard, you won’t be able to read.” I told him we could read, and he said, “Well, you may read, but not all.” Exactly at the same time, in the same semester, I was doing this course on brain-computer interfaces; it was the 6th semester. Professor KJM started teaching with the basics of molecular biology, proposing that we didn’t have knowledge regarding molecular biology. To some extent, he was true since no one studied, and kids were not answering the questions he was asking. But that doesn’t imply no one was answering the questions he was quizzing us with. I was there and answered every single one of his questions during his classes. 30% of the course he taught was only molecular biology. It was all already taught by Dr. Preeti Srivastava, thus I did know all of that. I had an “A” grade in that. </p><p id="b865ed55-6725-406e-ae72-5756c6ee91e8" class="">Then he started his usual so-called mathematical style of teaching. Pay attention here, all the mathematical discussion he does does not require more than 12th-grade calculus. You don’t need to master advanced numerical analysis or PDE to understand all that he lectures. Okay, but that doesn’t imply you can understand what he teaches. He will lecture in terms of cryptic arguments, which is nothing but manipulation. Exactly, all that he lectures are only texts and equations. So how does he make people bow down in front of him? The method is very dark. Exactly, when a person who is a professor has all the controls over how things are explained, he can always manipulate and brainwash and gaslight the entire class. It is always in his hands. There are tons of books on dark psychological methods. If you wish, I can provide you some references. That’s all that Professor KJM does; he is not some great researcher. He is a typical Bengali communist, leftist. </p><p id="0c3a6d4c-362a-4a4a-890b-dcf83901256c" class="">[11] Communists care more about thought control and surveillance and rarely wish for great research and development. They would rarely wish to teach you something great, something exciting; excitement is prohibited in communism. Here is a very good Netflix series worth watching (<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81159258">https://www.netflix.com/watch/81159258</a>). Think of it this way: if you are excited, you would like to buy something. When you buy something, two things happen: 1. You would want to have more money, and as per them, money is the root cause of all evilness. 2. You will fall into the trap of consumerism, which is the net spreaded by big billionaires. Thus, the billionaires would again become richer. </p><p id="89183aa8-f629-4d26-a5f5-e0119434a731" class="">Well, anyone can fall into this trap of argument, but those who know, they know that anyone can buy Adani Enterprises or NVIDIA stocks and be able to gain part of the profit and increase their wealth, exactly in the same ratio as Mr. Adani’s or Huang’s wealth increases. Secondly, they would argue that more profits go to the billionaire and less to the retail investors, but they don’t understand that a billionaire’s money is not actual money; it&#x27;s the price of the stocks or equity they have in the company they created. It always goes up and down. Today, if someone is a billionaire, tomorrow morning, he can go bankrupt. Mr. Dhirubhai Ambani had two sons, today no one knows the other, even though he was the world’s 4th richest around 2008. This kind of thing never happens in communist dictatorial regimes like NK or Russia or, why should I forget, WB. If someone becomes the ruler, he will remain until and unless he dies because of telomere shortening or heart failure. Communism is based on nepotism, oligarchy, and operates through goons sponsored by the state. There is an official ruling method, called the police department, and then there are goon friends. People ask why goons don’t get caught, why the police and intelligence agencies can’t catch them even when normal people can tell where an illegal gun factory is being operated, where opium trades are happening, beer brewing is happening, etc. The simple answer is they are kept there to instill fear in exactly those people who are saying that bad things are happening, and this isn’t stopped by the law enforcement department of the government, so they should fear and remain poor. This is how communists operate. The fundamental reason for jungle raj in Bihar is exactly this. All the goons are friends and family members of Mr. Laloo Prasad. </p><p id="f723ce38-e0c3-4f0c-908c-68f24ad0a379" class="">Why I am telling you all this is because communist regimes rarely invent new things. Research doesn’t come out of DEI or pessimism or thought control; it is a matter of free critical thinking and the highest end of optimism. Great things are invented not because someone forces you to do so but because of your willpower, your desire. That’s the fundamental reason the US invents things and Russia just copies and hacks them. And NK? Even Mr. Stalin knew the importance of freethinking for scientists; he didn’t execute that small group of physicists who were opposing Lysenkoism. It still amuses me that people like Sakharov and Norman Borlaug got Nobel <strong>Peace</strong> Prizes.</p><p id="a52ab227-10be-42f0-8a75-e028a71ce285" class="">[12] Okay, let me tell you something interesting. I got an “F” grade in Dr. KJM’s course, where he thought that if he provided research papers in the class, it would become difficult for people to read, and thus he kept the class trivial, while I got 89/100 in the course on BCI where every single day only research papers were being discussed. Someday will delve deep into how exactly I was the single person whom Mr. KJM awarded an “F” in the entire class. I do not leave people. I don’t.</p><p id="d3467758-7bfa-4efc-8828-d586ce6aa9da" class="">[13] To give you even more clue, do you think Dr. KJM was digging deep into enzyme science, something of his own theory, so he felt that other research papers would be useless? Wait, Dr. Amritanshu is Professor KJM’s favorite student. He was explaining something he himself didn&#x27;t understand correctly, and the facts he spoke were completely wrong. I sent him the paper that showed that whatever he was stating, proposing, and theorizing was completely incorrect. But, does that imply he accepted the truth and apologized for his mistake? Ah, how is that possible? Even Mr. KJM came to the battleground to favor his student, not the facts or to support critical thinking. That’s Dr. KJM. </p><p id="8a00076b-9d62-4d5c-bbdd-b5c5dac4fab1" class="">[14] Those who don’t know should respect him. I know him and the core of his thinking. By the way, I still respect him, bow down in front of him, and show utmost courtesy whenever I sit in front of him. Why? Simple, “never outshine the master,” otherwise, gateways to the roads to hell may open for you. That’s not a spiritual law written in Upanishads, but the first one of “the 48 laws of power.”</p><p id="66c35367-a697-4b0d-a7e3-88ba1c2ee4f7" class="">[15] Tyrants do not understand that their telomeres are also shortening and one day they are also going to get dissolved into the earth, water, and atmosphere. History is filled with such idiots. When the most vicious Duryodhana couldn’t confront the truth; the great Alexander got thrashed, Genghis got slaughtered, the tyranny of the once earth conqueror British Raj came to a shameful end, Indira got her karma fruited, Saddam, and many more; even Mr. Modi learned the lesson in this election. I don’t understand why people try to bend the truth. Tyrants get earthen in the flow of time. Truth always remains the same. Time and truth are the only things that exist. To be even more precise, it’s just the truth; time itself is an illusion, there is no existence of it in any of the planes of consciousness.</p><p id="f30e9e95-7a36-465f-ac8a-8409a60b94f6" class="">[16] Okay, let me ask you: How many of you know what a BCI is? Do you even know the definition of it? Exactly, none of you? I know many of you have heard it here and there, in the news or on Twitter, etc. but the truth is that whatever you know is pathetic. Why don’t you assign Prof. KJM to teach a course on BCI next semester? Exactly, all his pseudo-intellectualism would come to the ground. I request Professor KJM to teach an elective course on brain-computer interfaces next semester. It is very easy; as mentioned earlier, in order to become an expert, you only have to read 40 research papers on that topic. That’s it. I am sure you can do that. After all, you are a biotech professor, not a physicist, so the keywords and terms would also be more familiar to you than a mathematician or a civil engineer can have. </p><p id="5040bcc9-6818-4697-9745-9f2e0bb1d13a" class="">It is very easy; you can easily do that. If you need any help, please do let me know. I am always there for you. I can help you with finding key research papers, marking the importance of them. Although most people think that the number of citations is enough to determine that, it is still hard for someone who hasn’t been in the field. I can help you with that, having already done a course on BCI. Don’t worry. </p><p id="1c213ad5-79da-4466-bc55-e0b795ee673a" class="">You just have to go and lecture; we can handle all the background activities. If you wish, we can help you rehearse the lectures three times before you deliver them in the class. You know the MIT professor Walter Lewin, he has become above 90, but still whenever he goes to lecture, he rehearses three times beforehand, in the days before he delivers an actual lecture in class, you can find his physics lectures on YouTube, he is famous in entire world for the way he delivers the lecture.</p><p id="56f6f333-bbec-4b05-bc8e-68fbfc82dc1b" class="">[17] Why don’t you change this department’s name from “Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology” to “Department of Biotechnology and Computational Biology?” The time has come to shed the outdated moniker and embrace the true identity. &quot;Department of Biotechnology and Computational Biology&quot; isn&#x27;t just a name change - it&#x27;s a declaration of what the department is right now and where it is heading. I mean, how many of you are doing core biochemical engineering research? I know Prof. Atul is doing his usual stuff. Prof. KJM, although trained as a chemical engineer, is working on core molecular biology stuff. Basically, his lab works on doing molecular cloning for endless number of times. Biochemical engineering is a relic of the past and is totally outdated. Everyone is already into cutting-edge biotech and computational biology research, not tinkering with old-school bioreactors. </p><p id="548a7883-e5cf-4254-b428-fe1a440c9cb4" class="">The students crave the excitement of gene editing and AI-driven protein folding, not yawn-inducing downstream processing lectures. The biotech industry is evolving at breakneck speed, and they&#x27;re desperate for graduates who can code as well as they can pipette. Facebook, ByteDance, Google, Amazon, and all, all of them are not so secretly working on biotech projects, but who is working on how to calculate the error in measurements when you work on a bioreactor? Haha. Why should I laugh? It annoys me that I am laughing at a kid who didn’t learn how to calculate error propagation in his/her high school and is still entangled in that stuff in their PhD. Are you doing a PhD in error measurement? Do you love calculating errors so much? No! So then why are you doing it? You know my PI asked me to do it, if I do it, he will sign on my thesis. Okay, okay, I got it. Do it, and don’t worry, I am there for you when you need any help. </p><p id="cb561609-9e09-46db-b104-8fcb95b89081" class="">The work is already being done - the publications and projects scream &quot;computational biology&quot; louder than any antiquated department name ever could. By aligning the name with the true expertise, the department will attract the brightest minds, secure more funding, and cement its place at the forefront of biotechnology&#x27;s computational revolution. This isn&#x27;t just about staying relevant; it&#x27;s about leading the charge into the future of biotech. It&#x27;s time to answer the call of 2024 and beyond and not keep your head embedded in what you learned in 1970. 1970 was great and is important, but you need to embrace 2024. Wake up and dream big.</p><p id="8bea6e40-fd80-470b-bd83-940f887ef373" class="">[18] Whoever wants a review written like this for himself/herself/themselves, be a bit courageous and reply to this mail. You will be awarded with a lot of pleasure, so much pleasure, a lot more pleasure than I have provided in this work of art.

Enjoy.</p><p id="0c47cabe-db09-4315-abf4-417f2e8b6d00" class="">[19] Shilpi, it is very painful, I know, but remember it is just the fruit of your Karma. You should not be afraid of it, embrace it, and I would request you to take some positive action. Order cake, chocolate, and ice cream tonight and enjoy. Yes, I know it’s not your birthday tonight, your birthday in on 16th of March, exactly the same as my younger brother’s, thus I cannot forget that. But still, I am asking, do some favor for yourself. Even if you don’t know what the rolling circle mechanism is, merely not knowing a concept doesn&#x27;t imply that you are a devil or something. Your IQ may be low, you may have learned rudeness as part of making sure that you do not fall behind in the political race with your colleagues, but you don’t seem like a devil to me. I am sure you can always learn that. </p><p id="50d74ccb-7d92-4728-916f-f21c972ba183" class="">Tomorrow morning when you wake up, do not forget to do the Sudarshan Kriya that you have learned from your Gurudeva Sri Sri. It is a very good practice, helps to keep the thoughts and emotions balanced and energy very, very high. Again, if you have forgotten how to do Sudarshan Kriya because of long days of unpracticing, feel free to ask the volunteers, I too am a volunteer, you can always call me to help for any kind of mediations, I teach people how to meditate, do not laugh, I am a very good teacher, I have done a formal training, if anyone need to learn how to meditate I am always there, you can always call me, I can give you free demo sessions, I can teach you so many things. If that as well doesn’t help, repeat the course; hope you know how to. Next, I would suggest you go for an advanced meditation silence retreat when you find time for yourself; it will help you even more. And don’t keep thinking about what all I have done to you today, move on. </p><p id="daa327e1-a39e-4caf-b92f-7b3502004659" class="">“The damage has been done, now there is no way to build it the way it was earlier. The only thing that is in your hand is to take the criticism positively and try to improve yourself.” — Prof. KJM. Yes, that’s not what I am saying, that’s professor KJM said to me, and I didn’t accepted, I won’t accept, but I am sure Shilpi can accept that, you do respect him very much, you should respect him. </p><p id="5223fa15-7169-423c-bad7-132372932fda" class="">My dear, I would love to see you take a course in “environmental biotechnology,” “BBL341,” the teaching of which has been stopped just after Prof. Saroj Mishra left IIT Delhi. She was one of the best professors I have had the opportunity to attend lectures of. Prove that you are not lesser than her in any respect, you should try to do far better than hers. After all, she didn’t had an idea about the technological advancements which are going to happen in the future. For instance, she was no way aware that there would be some disruptive technology called LLMs coming in the future and that they would change the whole meaning of teaching and learning radically. Thus, the expectations are that you are going to do much better. </p><p id="4f4f94eb-9eca-4e0a-9814-36a231d8111a" class="">Dear Shilpi, I would request you to teach a course on advanced methods of genome editing technologies, the likes of which cross the syllabus of “recombinant DNA technology,” BBL733, taught by Prof. Ritu. Of course, whatever amount of information provided in r-DNA-tech by her is very unsatisfying. The reason may not be that Prof. Ritu is evil or stupid or something, but it can be that the time span and the syllabus won’t allow going deeper into genome editing technologies. Of course, genome engineering is a separate course in most universities. Thus, I surely request you to take a course on genome engineering as well. Yes, I have already assigned you three courses: microbiology, environmental biotechnology, and genome engineering. But this is not enough. </p><p id="224f2a86-7d26-4b1b-8c1f-620a91cc8acb" class="">If you think about your counterparts in the department of civil engineering, you would be surprised to see that all of them get assigned to teach four courses every academic year. On the other hand, I have seen you teaching only one course: microbiology, and you keep roaming around for the rest of the time. This is very lazy of you, and I condemn such behavior from you and your colleagues in this department. Many times, it feels like all of you guys have signed an MoU with each other, that I won’t teach, you don’t teach, and students are quite okay while fu*king around and not studying at all. </p><p id="9ab41c93-6691-47b4-ae95-3b4fd1f0fd2a" class="">When people like me appear in your department as an alien who is ultra-interested in learning, doing research, and entrepreneurship in biotech, you know the methods to mess up such a student. I have already described in my previous mails how you guys systematically fuck a cute kid. Well, not all the people know this mechanism, like the new professors who have no idea how things happen, but I am sure with time they too can learn the secret mechanism to destroy a dedicated student and the subtle art of imposing the reason for such a fuck on the poor guy himself. That’s the subtle art, destroy the guy systematically, and make sure the guy feels that it no one else but he himself is the reason for his destruction.</p><p id="4ddb0d97-5852-4cc8-8bfd-7c277d77ec99" class="">[20] I would request Prof. Preeti to teach a formal course on “synthetic biology,” an elective course in that. When I was there, she kept promising me that she would be teaching one but never did so. Later on, she would say there were not enough students interested in learning, but my dear ma’am, always remember, when you are ready to teach, you have that inner preparedness, the love for teaching, and the willpower to make it happen, you can always make it happen. Ramakrishna Paramhansa used to say, &quot;When a lotus blossoms, bees come from every direction. In the same way, when a teacher is ready with knowledge, students come from all directions.&quot; </p><p id="dddcbcf5-ea52-443a-b437-5037621cb5b7" class="">Exactly, you guys just keep throwing tons of excuses and keep making your weaknesses look like it’s the students&#x27; wickedness. I mean if you cannot get good students in IIT Delhi, then where do you think you can get, in the jungle like the Rishis or what? Maybe, that’s not incorrect. When there is Chanakya, there will always be Chandragupta, but it doesn’t work the other way. When the teachers themselves are stupid and idiot, they make thousands of excuses, and try to impose all their stupidity just to cover up their own stupidity. Excuses, you can always do that and you would have more free time when you do that compared to working hard and teaching something great to someone. But rest assured, you won’t get the happiness you deserve in your life that you get by sharing your knowledge in contrast to not sharing it for several vested interests, laziness, and excuses.</p><p id="d400aff1-712f-405e-a2c7-4c59bd9aa7a0" class="">

In fact, a ship, jack, or wolf can never transform into a lion. Lions are born, not nurtured. End of the nature vs. nurture debate. Period. — A lion rules the jungle through sheer strength and might, not through the act of being crowned by others.</p><p id="6dacd5ba-ef7d-47bc-b98b-43c78f61674a" class="">Although the laws of power suggest speaking less than required, I can give you a quantifiable technique to categorize and identify people easily. Categorizing is often considered an evil act, but do not be deluded; identifying people and their character is of utmost importance in the ranks of power. To be direct, those who have a CGPA below 7 are ships; if someone has a CGPA in the range of 7 to 8, they belong to jacks; those who have a CGPA above 8 are all wolves. </p><p id="7795119c-1391-4271-b5d7-81c1934fbaca" class="">Congressman, pay more attention—I am going to say something of utmost secrecy here. Those who have a CGPA above 9 are also wolves, but for them, the seduction procedure isn’t done by them but by their fathers and even higher-order mechanisms. If you are a new assistant professor, an HOD may ask you to increase their grades during grade moderation. You may get a call from higher authorities as well. You may find them a bit more sincere, but don’t be deluded; everyone is sincere. You may find them a bit wiser, but it is just the brightness of the respect and support they get from everywhere.</p><p id="f703bc9d-2529-4f77-a086-b6849f9c2015" class="">Well, but when it comes to a lion, you cannot identify by looking at the mere CGPA, which is nothing but a student’s professors’ bootlicking coefficient or SPBC. I think the better term would be CBCA, “commutative bootlicking coefficient average.” Such number are nothing for lions. Again, if you are focused enough, I must reiterate it to you, I have written “a lion,” and not “lions,” since yes, they are rare, in fact in a population of 10,000 you may not be able to find a single one, my analyses says, they are one is 30,000 in such populations like IIT Delhi etc. In short, they are rare rare rare.</p><p id="ae28a211-9317-4894-aab4-4cab56c19dfe" class="">Lions are born with a divine spark, their genes infused with celestial power.

Their integrity is unshakable, and their genuine spirit influences the very fabric of existence.
